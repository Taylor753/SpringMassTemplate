# SpringMassTemplate
# Taylor's version, attempting to implement this

1. ✅ Correct and auto initialization of particles. 

2. ✅ Correct and auto initialization of spring config.

3. ✅ Correct initialization of ground plane. 

4. ✅ Ground contact penetration penalty springs correctly and appropriately initialized. 

5. ✅ Ground contact penetatrion penalty springs correctly and appropriately updated.

6. ✅ Mesh vertices are correctly updated

7. ✅ Particle-particle spring forces are correctly computed and reflect force "trick"

8. ✅ Mesh bounds and normals are correctly updated after mesh modification

9. ✅ Symplectic Euler intregration scheme is correctly implemented

10. ✅ Sim loop updates all particle states

11. ✅ Recorded test case with given param values (on Brightspace)

12. ✅ Single file submitted called dewjones-taylor-a2-a2.zip with .gitignore pattern for unity

13. ✅ README.txt included
